# 🤖 Puzzlebot Project

Welcome to the collaborative repository for the **Puzzlebot** robot!  
This space is dedicated to the development and integration of various modules to bring our robot to life with both autonomous and manual control systems.

## 🚧 What You’ll Find Here

- 🎯 **Computer Vision**: Tools and scripts for object detection, navigation, and visual input processing.
- 🎮 **Manual Control**: Code for operating the robot via joystick or custom interfaces.
- 🔁 **Open-Loop & Closed-Loop Movement**: Movement systems based on different control strategies.
- 🧭 **Path Planning**: Algorithms for efficient navigation and route optimization.
- ⚫ **Line Follower**: Implementation for following predefined lines or paths.
- 🧪 **Experimental Modules**: Additional tools and features in development to expand robot capabilities.

## 💡 Goal

Build a flexible and robust framework for the Puzzlebot that supports testing, learning, and innovation through hands-on robotics programming.
